# Design system tokens
The BCC design system uses tokens to style different components. This enables a theming approach where the specific meaning of a token, such as which color is `primary` or `danger`, can change.

[![design tokens version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@bcc-code/design-tokens/latest?label=%40bcc-code%2Fdesign-tokens)](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-design-tokens/releases)

Install the tokens package with npm:
```sh
npm install @bcc-code/design-tokens@latest
```

::: warning HEADS UP
Be aware that the tokens currently are only useable in Tailwind and with the default BCC Forbundet theme. We're still iterating on this, so expect support for more platforms and themes in the future.

Be sure to check out the documentation for the [Vue component package](../vue-components/README.md).
