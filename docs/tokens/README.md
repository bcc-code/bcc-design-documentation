# Design system tokens
The BCC design system uses tokens to style different components. This enables a theming approach where the specific meaning of a token, such as which color is `primary` or `danger`, can change.

[![design tokens version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@bcc-code/design-tokens/latest?label=%40bcc-code%2Fdesign-tokens)](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-design-tokens/releases)

Install the tokens package with npm:
```sh
npm install @bcc-code/design-tokens@latest
```

At the moment the tokens are only usable together with the [Vue component package](../vue-components/README.md), so be sure to check out their documentation.
