# Getting Started
::: warning
This documentation is work in progress of a new setup. Refer to the existing [CSS library](../css-library/README.md) or [Vue components](../vue-components/README.md) documentation for usage with the latest released version.
:::

The design system consists of a set of [guidelines](../guidelines.md) and components. At the moment these components can be used by installing one of these libraries:

- [@bcc-code/design-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcc-code/design-components)
- [@bcc-code/vue-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcc-code/vue-components)

Additionally, if you can't use npm in your project, it's possible to use the compiled CSS file from a CDN, but this is not recommended for production apps.
